# Recurring concepts in web development

- **REST:** REST, or REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other. REST-compliant systems, often called RESTful systems, are characterized by how they are stateless and separate the concerns of client and server.

    - Separation of client qnd server: In the REST architectural style, the implementation of the client and the implementation of the server can be done independently without each knowing about the other. As long as each side knows what format of messages to send to the other, they can be kept modular and separate.

    - Statlessness: Systems that follow the REST paradigm are stateless, meaning that the server does not need to know anything about what state the client is in and vice versa.
