### What are secrets?

A Secret is an object that contains a small amount of sensitive data such as a password, a token, or a key.
Kubernetes Secrets let you store and manage this **sensitive information** in a **safer** and more flexible manner, rather than putting it directly in a Pod definition or in a container image.
