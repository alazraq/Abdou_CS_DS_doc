# Fixed Income and Credit Risk

- Today we are talking about bonds mostly.
- Fixed income securities: give the owner a predetermined cash flow, typically a bond.
- Bond market very important but 
- Key event you want to predict is discrete and rare: default of the borrower (company dying), so data analysis tools

## Overview of fixed income markets

## Vocabulary

The borrower gets an amount M today, 

- Principal M: the amount you borrow.
- r is the interest rate.
- rM
- D = (1+M)
- T is the maturity. 

- Negotiable: can be sold and bought
- Usually bank loans are non-negotiable bi-lateral contracts, securitization is the process of transforming a portfolio of loans into negotialble securities.

### Counter parties

### Maturities

- Money market: debt instruments with maturity less than 1 year.
- Perpetual bonds: do not have infinite value because of time discounting.

The bond specifies how much the lender is going to get from a contract (fixed income), as opposed to stocks where you get dividends (variable and not known in advance)

- Analysts and investors utilize the Merton model to understand how capable a company is at meeting financial obligations, servicing its debt, and weighing the general possibility that it will go into credit default.

## Merton's Model - implications

- Simulation: B_t converges to V_t, as we go lower than the par value D, the bond's value converges to the total value of the assets of the company -> shows that the formula works
