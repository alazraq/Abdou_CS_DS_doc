Business 
########

Business is the activity making money by producing or buying and selling products (such as goods and services).

Here I focus on the business skills I was able to gather during my engineering career especially during my second year of master at HEC Paris, and more importantly in my early career as Head Of Engineering at Virtual Traffic Lights LLC. 

These are basic business concepts including rudimentary management, finance, accounting, sales and marketing skills necessary for a successful career leading a business.
