Business 
########

In this section, I try to keep a running log where I document the most important business skills I was able to develop during my early career as Head of Engineering at Virtual Traffic Lights LLC, my early years as an entrepreneur, and earlier in school at HEC Paris.

These skills are organized in 5 buckets, that follow the definition of "Business" by Josh Kaufman in his excellent book `My Personal MBA`. 

.. note::
   A business is a repeatable process that:

   1. Creates and delivers something of value;
   2. That other people want or need;
   3. At a price they're willing to pay:
   4. In a way that satisfies the customer's needs and expectations;
   5. So that the business brings in enough profit to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operation.

Based on this definition, at its core every business (whether it is a small startup or a multi-billion company) is fundamentally a collection of five interdependent processes, each of which flows into the next:

1. **Value Creation:** Discovering what people need or want, then creating it.
2. **Marketing:** Attracting attention and building demand for what you've created.
3. **Sales:** Turning prospective customers into paying customers.
4. **Value Delivery:** Giving your customers what you've promised and ensuring that they're satisfied.
5. **Finance:** Bringing in enough money to keep going and make your effort worthwhile.

I will continuously reference Josh Kaufman's book throughout this section, and add elements from my own personal experience and other books within each section of this framework.

For example, the `Value Delivery` section will include many concepts from the `Project Management Body of Knowledge Guide (PMBOK)` which in fact influences all 5 processes.

These 5 processes are the core ones, others that may seem missing from this framework can be included in these most of the time, for example:

* The **Research and Development (R&D)** process could also be included in the **Value Creation** process by expanding the focus of this process to include not only the creation of value for customers but also the creation of new knowledge and the development of new products, services, or processes. This would involve activities such as ideation, prototyping, testing, and commercialization.
* The **Human Resources (HR)** process could be included under **Value Delivery**  by expanding the focus of this process to include not only the delivery of value to customers but also the creation and maintenance of a high-performing workforce. This would involve activities such as talent acquisition, talent development, performance management, and employee engagement and well-being.

Some others that could be added as seperate processes in my opinion, include:

* **Strategic Planning:** Strategic Planning could be included as a new process that sits above the other four processes and provides a clear direction and a set of priorities for the organization. This would involve activities such as market analysis, competitive analysis, SWOT analysis, and scenario planning. It would also support the other four processes by providing a framework for decision-making and resource allocation.
* **Risk Management:** Risk Management could be included as a new process that sits alongside the other four processes and provides a framework for managing the risks associated with those processes. This would involve activities such as risk identification, risk assessment, risk mitigation, and risk monitoring. It would also support the other four processes by providing a framework for managing the uncertainty and volatility that are inherent in any business.
