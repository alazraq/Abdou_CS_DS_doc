# Developing a winning sales strategy

## What is a selling strategy?

A sales strategy is a plan that describes how a business will win, retain and develop customers.

## Lean startup sales strategy

In ‘lean start-up’ terminology sales strategy is commonly referred to as the ‘customer development strategy’.
