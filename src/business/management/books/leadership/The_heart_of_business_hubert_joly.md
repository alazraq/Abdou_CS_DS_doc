# The Heart of Business: Leadership principles for the next era of capitalism - Hubert Joly

## Foreword: Importance of a company being mission driven

- **What:** Every company needs to focus on its purpose, or raison d’être, in order to establish legitimacy in serving society by creating value for all stakeholders.
- **Why:** Sustainable profits are the successful outcome of organizations that are mission driven and focus on all their stakeholders.
- **How:** Complete turnaround of the company, then crafting of the company’s mission “to enrich customers’ lives through technology”, inspiring employees to align in pursuit of a common purpose.

## Introduction

- This book reflects that the leader I have become is an **amassing and meshing of thousands of ideas from thousands of places.** 

## Book outline

There are four parts in this book: 

- Part one offers a far more inspiring and positive alternative to the traditional notion of work. Work is not a curse or something you do so that you can do something else; it can be part of our search for meaning and our fulfillment as human beings.

- Part two examines why the traditional view that the primary purpose of business is to maximize shareholder value is wrong, dangerous, and ill-suited to today’s environment. Instead, the purpose of a company has to be to contribute to the common good and serve all its stakeholders in a harmonious fashion. In order to do so, companies must be viewed as human organizations made of individuals working together in support of an inspiring common “noble purpose.” In the architecture of a new approach to business, a noble purpose is the raison d’être of corporations, and people are at the center of everything they do.

- Part three is about the very human dimension that powers this new approach to business and how to unleash what I call human magic. This requires creating an environment that can energize each individual working at the company and results in performance so extraordinary I like to call it irrational performance.

- Finally, Part four details the qualities of leadership needed to pull all this together—the five “Be’s” of the purposeful leader. Today’s leaders have to be purposeful, be clear about who they serve, be conscious of what their true role is, be driven by values, and be authentic.

## Part 1: The meaning of work

### 1 - Adam's curse

- Work historically seen as a burden
- This book is about how to turn disengaged people that merely show up for work or are actively hating their jobs into engaged employees.

### 2 - Why we work

- Work is part of a man's search for meaning
- Victor Frankl: Life, he concluded, is not a quest for pleasure or for power. It is instead **a quest for meaning**, which ultimately is the path to fulfillment and happiness. And according to him, one can find meaning in three possible places: work, love, and courage. In truth, they often converge; doing something significant through work often involves caring for others and overcoming adversity.
- Author's purpose in life: making a positive difference for people around me and using the platform I have to make a positive difference in the world.
