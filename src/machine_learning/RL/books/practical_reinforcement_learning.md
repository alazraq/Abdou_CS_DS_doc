# Practical Reinforcement Learning

- Academia vs practical RL: Reinforcement learning (RL) for traffic management is an old subject, but only recently has it gained enough prominence to raise its head outside of academia. The vast majority of the literature talks about algorithms and contrived simulations.
- RL life cycle vs ML vs Software eng: the life cycle of an RL project is quite different from ML and very different to software engineering. Software engineering is to RL what bricklaying is to bridge building.
- Stress during development, which I think is different than normal stress, is proportional to the amount of mental effort expended on a problem and inversely proportional to the probability of success.
