Miscellaneous Topics in Machine Learning
########################################

You will find here articles about other very interesting subjects related to Machine Learning like model interpretability, privacy preseving ML etc. 
We will try to tackle both the ideology behind such topics and the technical implementations to apply these ideas to real-word Machine Learning models. 

Most of these subjects came as part of discussions with guest speakers that gave talks during my master at Ecole Polytechnique and HEC Paris and that I thought are worth elaborating. 

Usually there will be a trade-off between model performance and one of these (interpretability, privacy).
