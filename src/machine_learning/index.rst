Machine Learning
################

In this section, I will focus on the three basic Machine Learning paradigms: supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. Most of the material in this section is inspired by my notes attending 10-601 Introduction to Machine Learning class at Carnegie Mellon University and several ML classes at Ecole Polytechnique.
