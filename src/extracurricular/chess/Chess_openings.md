# Abdou's Chess Openings Reference 

Recognizing and understanding the best openings can increase your confidence in the beginning phase of the game. This is a reference of how to play the most common chess openings as black and as white.

## Ruy Lopez


The starting position of the Ruy Lopez is reached after the following moves: 1. e4, e5; 2. Nf3, Nc6; and 3. Bb5.

### Morphy defense 3..a6

By far the most commonly played third move for Black is the Morphy Defence, 3...a6, which "puts the question" to the white bishop. The main point of 3...a6 is that after the common retreat 4.Ba4, Black will have the possibility of breaking a future pin on the queen knight by playing ...b5.

#### Closed defence


Closed defence is on board when 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 are played. This is the normal line and the most commonly played. 

##### Main line of the closed defence

The main line of the closed defence is 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 0-0

Explanation: after 5.0-0 Be7 are played, black now threatens to win a pawn with 6...b5 followed by 7...Nxe4, so White must respond. Usually White defends the e-pawn with 6.Re1 which, in turn, threatens Black with the loss of a pawn after 7.Bxc6 and 8.Nxe5. Although it is possible to defend the pawn with 6...d6, Black most commonly averts this threat by driving away the white bishop with 6...b5 7.Bb3.
So after 4...Nf6 5.0-0 Be7, the most frequently seen continuation is 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 0-0 

#### The Exchange Variation



### Steinitz defence

### Berlin defence

## Italian game

The starting position of the Italian Game is reached after the following moves: 1. e4, e5; 2. Nf3, Nc6; and 3. Bc4

### Two knights defence

### Hungarian defence

## Sicilian defence

The starting position of the Sicilian defence is reached after the following moves: 1. e4, c5

The Sicilian defense is black's most popular response to e4, especially at the highest levels of chess. By playing c5, black immediately fights for the center and attacks d4 but avoids the symmetry of e5. 

### Closed Sicilian

### Classical Sicilian

### Dragon variation

### Najdorf variation

## The French defence

The French defense (1. e4, e6) concedes central space to white and limits the scope of his king's bishop but prevents tactics against f7 while allowing black to have activity on the queenside and counterplay in the center.

After the most typical line of 2. d4, d5, white's "e" pawn is immediately pressured, and white must decide how to deal with this. This leads to several variations including the exchange variation, advance variation, Tarrasch variation, Winawer variation, and classical variation.
