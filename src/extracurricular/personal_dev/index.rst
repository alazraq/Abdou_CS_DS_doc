Personal Development
####################

I am a firm believer in the process of personal development as a way to **progressively realize worthwhile, predetermined personal goals** (which is how I define success).

The goal of this section is to share with you the concepts and ideas that had the biggest influence on my personal development, most of which come from books I read, seminars and classes I attended, and discussions I sparked with personal development coaches since the age of 10.

Here, I will focus on two complementary systems that are the backbone of personal development in my opinion: 

- The Goal Planning System, or GPS for short, which is about the results you want to achieve. 
- The Atomic Habits System which is about the processes that lead to those results.
