Social development
##################

While personal development principles can lead you to private victory (independence), we live in an interdependent world where you can't achieve maximum effectiveness through independence.

There are three types of people:

- Dependent people need others to get what they want. 
- Independent people can get what they want through their own effort. 
- Interdependent people combine their own efforts with the efforts of others to achieve their greatest success.

That being said, interdependence is a choice only independent people can make, so please do take a look at the personal development notes I put together before reading any further here.

This chapter aggregates social skills I was able to gather from different books I read, seminars I attended and from my own personal experiences.
It aims at taking you from independence to true interdependence, and achieving public victory.
