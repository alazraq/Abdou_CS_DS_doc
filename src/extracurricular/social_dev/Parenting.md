## Financial education

- **Home vs school for financial education:** Financial literacy is mostly taught in the family, not in the classroom.
- **Family Wealth Education Nights:** To demystify financial education, it’s important to create a family ritual around discussing money issues on a regular basis, such as Family Wealth Education Nights.
- **Best age to start teaching kids about money:** Parents often wonder when is a good time to start teaching children about money. The answer is whenever kids can tell the difference between a one dollar and five dollar bill.
- **Three Windows of Learning:** There are three main windows of learning that all humans go through. 

- The first is from birth to age 12. At this stage, they are sponges absorbing everything around them. Everything sparks their curiosity, and they are very quick learners. This is the best time to teach them anything. 
- The second window, from age 12 to 24, is characterized by rebellious learning because it’s how kids learn at this age. They want to make their own decisions, and this is where the majority of intergenerational conflict arises. As a general rule, children will resist their parents' commands. It all comes down to how the parents handle rebellion. They can either fight their kids and drive them to do the wrong thing, or try to understand them and steer them in the right direction.
- The third window, professional learning, is from age 24 to 36. Usually, young people marry, establish families, and purchase their first homes during this time period, and the harsh financial implications of the real world begin to seep in. Increasingly, life revolves on money and the shortage of it. Ultimately, the lessons kids learn about money throughout the first two learning windows will determine how they respond to increased financial stress in the third.

- **Let Kids Dream** As parents, it's crucial to create an atmosphere where your kids may freely express their hopes and goals for the future. A child's brilliance is hidden in their dreams.
