# Flutter getting started:

## What is Flutter?

Flutter is Google's mobile app SDK for crafting high-quality native interfaces on iOS and Android in record time. 

Flutter is a mobile app SDK, complete with framework, widgets, and tools, that gives developers a way to build and deploy mobile apps, written in Dart (which is in my opinion one of the most easy languages to write code in from a developer's perspective).

## Quick start on VS code

- Install Dart and Flutter plugins
- From command palette (cmd + shift + P) run Flutter: New Project, this will create a complete structure of a basic flutter project for you
- From command palette (cmd + shift + P) run Flutter: Launch Emulator, this will launch an emulator if you have already setup one (PS: the emulator is independent of the IDE)

Now you can modify and run your app, you can also modify your app while running thanks to hot reload.

## Useful commands

- Run a flutter app once you have launched an emulator or connected a device:

    flutter run
