Dimensionality reduction
########################
 
**Dimensionality reduction** aims at transforming data from a high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional space so that the low-dimensional representation retains some meaningful properties of the original data.
This builds on the fact that more input features often make a predictive modeling task more challenging to model, this problem is more generally referred to as the curse of dimensionality.
