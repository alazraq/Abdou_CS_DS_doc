Supervised Learning
###################

Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on labeled training data consisting of a set of input-output pairs called training examples. In this section we explore some algorithms used for solving the two types of supervised learning problems, classification and regression. This is mostly based on my note from the 5 ML classes I took at Carnegie Mellon University and Ecole Polytechnique but is not meant to be a complete reference.
