Classification
##############

A classification problem is the category of supervised learning problems whose goal is to identify to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known. 

The goal of this section is to explore the most famous classification algorithms, it is mostly based on my lecture notes from Ecole Polytechnique ML classes.
