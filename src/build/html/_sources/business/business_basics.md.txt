## Parts of the Business

Top executives are top executives because they understand what every department in the company does and what is capable of. So it is important to know the team around you no matter in which department you are:

- **Finance** getting money via loans or from investors
- **Accounting** keeping track of the money - How much cash do we have? Do we owe our suppliers money? How much does our customer owe us?
- **Marketing** knowing your customers and finding new ones, understanding what customers like about our products and services, and what they'd like us to change or develop.
- **Sales** developing relationships with customers and then work to sell them goods and services at a competitive price. This helps bring in revenues. Having a good product that customers want to buy is only part of the battle.
- **Supply chain** buying, making, and moving products so customers get the right item at the right place at the right time.
- **Information technology team** collecting, storing and processing data generated by the business.
- **Human resources** hiring good employees and retaining those people.
