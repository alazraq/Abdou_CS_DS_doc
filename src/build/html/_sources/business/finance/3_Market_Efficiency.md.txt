# Market Efficiency

## Introduction

### Market efficiency definition (Informational efficiency: is the price right?)

- Models like the CAPM are "nomative" it says what asset prices and returns should be.
- In efficient markets, actual prices and expected returns are equal to their normative value. If markets are efficient, then all information is already incorporated into prices, and so there is no way to "beat" the market because there are no undervalued or overvalued securities available.
    - Every asset has alpha = 0
    - Enough smart investors in the market that the price already raised to incorporate new information and you will only have the regular expected return but not more than that.
- In inefficient markets, asset prices and expected returns sometimes differ from their normative value
    - Negative alpha, you want to buy this asset as it is undervalued
    - Positive alpha, you want to sell
    - Smart investors can make money in inefficient markets, but not so smart investors can also lose a lot of money.


### Market efficiency example

- Sales go up by 25% is not necessarily good news if we were expecting more, so prices can go down.

### Hedge funds

- Hedge funds invest their clients' money in capital markets.
- Short-sell, sell an asset that you don't necessarily have, borrow the stock from a broker.
- Hedge funds have fees, fixed ones and some depending on performance
- AUM: Assets under management

## Are markets efficient
- Academics and investors have found many portfolios with positive alpha.
- High profitability not fully captured by the models.

## Issues for data scientists

### Risk adjustment: have we correctly adjusted for systematic risk?

### Data snooping: out-of-sample validity?
- Forecasting in finance depends on the behaviour of all other people that are trying to forcast.
