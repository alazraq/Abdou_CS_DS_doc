# Introduction to finance

## Overview of finance and financial markets

### Broad definition

Finance is the exchange of money against money (in different forms), for example:
- Loans: money today against future repayment.
- Stocks: money today against future dividents.
- Insurance: money today against future compensation. 
- Foreign exchange: one currency against another.
- etc

### Standard definition

Finance is a term for matters regarding the management, creation, and study of money and investments. Specifically, it deals with the questions of how and why an individual, company or government acquires the money needed – called capital in the company context – and how they spend or invest that money.

### Intermediation

- **Definition:** A financial institution receives money from one counterparty and gives it to the other.

- **Types** Main two types of intermediation:

#### Bank Intermediation - assets and liabilities

- **Commercial Banks** are financial institutions that collect deposits (see more in the deposits section below) from old households and make loans to young households and firms.
- The **Net worth** of a bank is the difference between assets and liabilities, both listed on **bank's balance sheet**.

##### Bank assets

- **Bank assets** are all the loans, securities (see Market Finance subsection), reserves, physical assets etc that a bank owns, they are listed on the left-hand side of a bank's balance sheet. The largest asset category of most bank is loans, which generates interest revenue. A critical asset category used to maintain the safety of deposits is reserves (vault cash and Federal Reserve deposits).

- A **loan** is a financial contract where the lender gives money to the borrower in exchange for predetermined future repayments. Examples of loans include:
    - **Mortgages:** If you don't pay we take your house.
    - **Credit card debt:** Generally money borrowed crried over from month to month using credit cards. 
    - **Corporate loans:**
    - **Auto loans**
    - **Student loans** 

- Bank **reserves** are the cash minimums that must be kept on hand by financial institutions in order to meet central bank requirements. The bank cannot lend the money but must keep it in the vault, on-site or at the central bank, in order to meet any large and unexpected demand for withdrawals.

##### Bank liabilities

- **Bank liabilities** are what a bank owes, they are listed on the right-hand side of a bank's balance sheet. 

- A (demand) **deposit** is a financial contract: the depositor gives money to the bank today and can collect it at any future point in time on demand. Deposits are typically insured by the government (the government steps in of the bank cannot repay the depositor). The deposit itself is a liability owed by the bank to the depositor.

#### Market finance - securities

- A **security** is a financial instrument negotiable on a market that can be readily transferred or sold for cash. Stocks are one form of security, as are bonds, notes, mineral royalties, options and futures contracts. 
- Here we explore Stocks and Bonds more in depth.

##### Bonds

- A **Bond** is a debt security entitling the owner to predetermined future repayments.
- **Bond vs Stock** Bonds are debts while stocks are stakes of ownership in a company.
- Example: Boing is issuing new bonds with a value of $3 000 000 00$, repayment is due 2023 with the rate of 4.508% interest rate every year.
- Debt securities slide: All the bonds that are still standing on the market (not yet due)
- Sometimes the governement chooses to bail-out a company that goes bankrupt. Repay the bonds as well.

##### Stocks

- **Initial Public Offering (IPO)** or stock market launch is a type of public offering in which new shares of a company are sold to institutional investors and usually also retail investors. Usually during the IPO the share price is quite low so it is usually a good deal to buy at the IPO, but not always haha.
- **Market capitalization**, commonly called market cap, is the market value of a publicly traded company's outstanding shares (ex: lemonade.png).
- Q&A:
    1. Q: How are share price determined? A: valuation by a financial expert
    2. Q: Does selling more shares make current shareholders loose a lot of money? A: If the price per share at the IPO is correctly set, then you own less shares as a more valuable company so it should be fine. 

- **Seasoned equity offering:** already public company issuing new shares.
- **Listing decision:** choose where to issue your shares, prices in all market are virtually identical
- **Stock split:** ex: from 100 million shares at 50$ to 200 mil shares at 25$
- **Share turnover** is a measure of stock liquidity calculated by dividing the total number of shares traded over a period by the average number of shares outstanding for the period. The higher the share turnover, the more liquid company shares are.

- Life of a Stock:
    - Start with a firm: wants to sell parts of the company
    - They get help of the investment bank to determine the price of a share (underwriting)
    - Broker: intermediation between households and markets, Robinhood etc, take your order and execute your order
    - Asset manager: intermediation between households and brokers, investors can delegate the management of their portfolio to an asset manager.
    - Market-makers/Dealers 

##### Types of financial markets

We distinguish two markets:

- Primary market: market for newly issued securities (Bond, stock etc)
- Secondary market: for already traded securities

Main stock exchanges:

- NYSE: sum of all market cap of companies is 21.04 Trillion 
- NASDAQ
- Tokyo Stock exchange

#### More intermediation

- **Investment banks (IBs)** help firm issue securities: pricing, placement, legal documentation etc
- **Market-makers and dealers (often IBs)** buy and sell securities on their own account, intermediating between final investors, more in article 3.
- **Brokers** execute the trades of investors.
- **Asset managers** invest in securities on behalf of investors. The investors then own shares in a fund.
    - **Mutual funds** charge fees based on a percentage of assets under management (AUM).
    - **Hedge funds** on the other hand, charge both management fees and performance fees.
