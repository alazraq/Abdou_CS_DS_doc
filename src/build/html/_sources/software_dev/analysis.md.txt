# Analysis of users requirements

Requirements Analysis is the process of defining the expectations of the users for an application that is to be built or modified. 
It is at the intersection of *Business* and *Software Development* since the requirement modeling should be high level to make sense to stakeholders, but should also be simple, specific and clear enough for the developers to be able to implement them. 

The requirements analysis process involves eliciting, analyzing, modeling and then reviewing the requirements. 
Here we only focus on the modeling part and leave the rest for the Business expertise section.

## User stories

User stories are the preferred format for modeling the requirements in the Agile methodology.
