Packaging, Containerization and deployment of Software
######################################################

Software deployment is all of the activities that make a software system available for use. 
With modern web services, users expect applications to be available 24/7, and developers expect to deploy new versions of those applications several times a day. 
Containerization helps package software to serve these goals, enabling applications to be released and updated in an easy and fast way without downtime.
Here we mainly focus on Docker as a packaging tool and Kubernetes for deployment.
