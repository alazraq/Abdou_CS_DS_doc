# Docker tips

## Useful commands

- Showing all containers created:

```
docker ps -a
```

- run command params:
    - ``--detach`` or ``-d`` detached mode means that the process is not linked to your terminal, run container in background and print container ID
    - ``--rm`` clean up the container and remove the file system when the container exits, including anonymous volumes (by default a containerâ€™s file system persists even after the container exits)
    - ``-v`` used for [mounting volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) which are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers
    - ``-e`` used for specifying environment variables
