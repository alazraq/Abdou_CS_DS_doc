# Atomic Habits System

## Introduction

- Tiny compound changes accumulate over time to remarkable results. 
    - An example of this is the British cycling team which made a series of tiny improvements to every aspect of cycling, including overlooked and unexpected areas, and ended up dominating the sport for 10 consecutive years.
    - Mathematically, if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the end of the year. 1.01^365 = 37.78
- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits, so you should be more concerned with your current habits (trajectory towards next states) than your current state.
    - The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.
    - This can be a difficult concept to appreciate in daily life. We make a few changes, but the results never seem to come quickly and so we slide back into our previous routines.
    - Habits seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent (e.g. a tiny shift in the nose of the airplane at takeoff could lead youto different destinations). 
    - It doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.
- Your habits can compound for you or against you
    - Positive compounding examples: 
        - Productivity compounds: automating tasks (e.g. habits stacking) is one hell of a tool. The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other areas.
- System-oriented vs goal-oriented mindset (basketball training)
- Habit = Queue (1&2) - action (3) - reward (4)
- Stoping bad habits and implementing good ones


## How to build a good habit

### 1st law of behaviour change: Make it Obvious

- First write current habits and label good or bad to become aware of them
- Implementation intentions: where and when you want to do that habit, places become queues
- Habits stacking (after current habit, I will) -> queues (déclencheurs) are habits themselves (douae - chaf3)
- Designing the environment (balcon, eau)

### 2nd law of behaviour change: Make it attractive

-  Temptation bundling: Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do (moua3n)
- Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior (Echecs Poljak)
- Create a motivation ritual. Do something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit. (what I like, 15 min youtube before work)

### 3rd law of behaviour change: Make it easy

- Priming the environment (preparing Pc mac before sleep)
- Master the decisive moment (mettre habits pour sport)
- Use two minute rule for difficult habits (personal devlopment - Quran)
- Automate your habits. Invest in technology and onetime purchases that lock in future behavior. (Calendar)

### 4th law of behaviour change: Make it satisfying

- Use reinforcement. Give yourself an immediate reward when you complete your habit. (glace 18/18)
- Make “doing nothing” enjoyable. When avoiding a bad habit, design a way to see the benefits. (money for future purchase)
- Never miss twice (awab)


## How to break a bad habit

### Inversion of the 1st law: Make it invisible

- Reduce exposure. Remove the cues of your bad habits from your environment (ex: shut down phone and computers at 10pm)

### Inversion of the 2nd law: Make it unattractive

- Reframe your mindset. Highlight the benefits of avoiding your bad habits. (take every queue and destroy it, ex smoking book: you have no reason to smoke if you don't win any benefits) 
- Cravings are specific manifestation of a deeper underlying motive of human nature (tacos - eat food to survive, insta - socialize), there are many ways to adress the same underlying motive (reduce anxiety - smoke a cigarette or go for a run), a habit is not the best way to adress a motive, it is just one we associate easily with it and keep coming back to it
- Take three deep breaths and smile  when doing what makes you feel happy, then do when want to change the mood


### Inversion of the 3rd law: Make it difficult

- Increase friction. Increase the number of steps between you and your bad habits. (Victor Hugo - lock all of his clothes to avoid going out and write)
- Use a commitment device. Restrict your future choices to the ones that benefit you. (a commitment device - something you do now to restrict your future choices ex hugo, tie hero to the ship) - lock yourself up when your mind is in the right place rather than waiting where your desires take you when the moment comes (light yagami)

### Inversion of the 4th law: Make it unsatisfying

- Get an accountability partner. Ask someone to watch your behavior. (Public shame is worse than private one)
- Create a habit contract. Make the costs of your bad habits public and painful. (200$ if misses gym)
