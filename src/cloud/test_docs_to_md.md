## Introduction and general information

The goal of this document is to provide an overview of the subjects I will tackle during my personal project. It also serves as a reporting tool as I will try to include more details about my day to day work under the “Reporting” section. Some general information about the context of this personal project is provided below.



*   **School:** Ecole Polytechnique - HEC Paris
*   **Program:** Data Science for Business
*   **Student:** Abderrahmane Lazraq
*   **Schedule:** February 3rd to March 30th 2021
*   **Supervisor: **Vincent Fraitot


## Objectives

There are two objectives for this personal project: getting familiar with cloud computing fundamentals in Azure and exploring privacy preserving machine learning techniques.


#### Getting familiar with cloud computing fundamentals in Azure

The goal here is to acquire foundational knowledge of cloud computing using Azure. By the end of this part, I should be familiar with:



*   Most important cloud concepts
*   Core Azure services
*   Core solutions and management tools on Azure
*   General security features
*   Identity, governance, privacy, and compliance features

The reasons behind this choice are:



*   A general feeling of unfamiliarity with cloud computing when it is one of the most important tools in a data scientist skill set. 
*   The need to complement “Cloud and ML” classes in which we had a good overview of cloud services but lacked the time to deep dive into some services that are of particular interest to me.
*   Particular focus on Azure anticipating my upcoming internship at Microsoft.


#### Privacy preserving machine learning - Literature review

After getting familiar with cloud fundamentals in Azure, I want to explore the existing literature on privacy preserving techniques in machine learning. These are novel techniques allowing to process private information without disclosing it to persons engaged in the processing. 

The goal is to learn the core principles behind different privacy preservation technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs, secure multi-party computations and homomorphic encryption, then forecast the perspectives of encrypted data processing in the years to come. 

The reasons behind this choice are:



*   General interest in security and privacy following classes I took during my Bachelor on the subject and desire to apply this knowledge to ML.
*   The wish to expand on the excellent lecture given by Daniel Hunyh on the subject during our deep learning 2 class at HEC.
*   This literature review will serve as a solid basis for my upcoming research paper on a more punctual privacy-preserving technique to be defined.


## Planning

Since there are two objectives for this personal project, the planning is naturally split into two. The first part, which takes place during the month of February, is dedicated to getting familiar with cloud services by following Azure Fundamentals [official learning path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-fundamentals##certification-exams). The second part is dedicated to reviewing important building blocks for cryptographic protection of data processing, before we explore novel privacy preserving machine learning techniques one by one and deciding which techniques are the most promising and potentially identifying new applications for these techniques.

**Important note:** This is the initial planning but might be subject to modifications, it will be kept up to date throughout the personal project duration.

## Sources of information

For part 1:



*   [Azure fundamentals series](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-fundamentals) which is a six-part series that teaches cloud concepts, provides a streamlined overview of many Azure services through lectures and hands-on exercises.
*   Official [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/?product=featured).

For part 2:



*   [Openmined](https://www.openmined.org/) which is an open source community whose goal is lowering the barrier-to-entry to private AI technologies.
*   [Azure Confidential Computing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/confidential-compute/##overview) documentation.
