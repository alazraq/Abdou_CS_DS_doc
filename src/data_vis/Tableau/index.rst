Tableau
#######

Tableau is an interactive data visualization software and a must to have tool in any data scientist toolbox. I was first introduced to Tableau during my exchange year at Carnegie Mellon University but I had a chance to explore it more in depth during my master at HEC Paris.

The goal of this article is to give you an overview of Tableau's capabilities, to highlight some of the cool aspects of the visual analytics process in Tableau and finally to gather all the tips and tricks I assembled during my use of Tableau in a single place.

Parts of this article are based on the excellent book ``Visual analytics with Tableau`` by Alexander Loth, referred to as ``Tableau book`` in subsequent sections.
