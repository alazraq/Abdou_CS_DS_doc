# Introduction and getting started with Tableau

There are many different Tableau products:
- Tableau Desktop: An application for Windows and Mac, this is what we will be exploring here.
- Tableau Prep: Used to prepare data (cleaning, correctly formatting, etc) data before exploring it in Tableau Desktop.
- Tableau Server: Platform for data analysis for companies.
- Tableau Online: Cloud-based Tableau-hosted solution for hosting and deploying dashboards.
- Tableau Public: Hosting service for the publication of data visualizations to the web, used by bloggers and newsrooms.
- Tableau Reader: Free desktop app to interact with Tableau workbook files.

Here we will focus on Tableau Desktop. 
Details about the Tableau application suite as well as instructions for installing Tableau Desktop can be found in Chapter 1 of the book.

## Data preparation

There are certain requirements a dataset should meet for easy use in Tableau. The most important of these requirements is to **use raw data** as much as possible: We prefer long tables with a single data point in each row to wide tables with aggregated mesaures like averages etc. We want raw data, averages and other measures can be computed later using Tableau.

If the dataset you are presented with is not in this raw format, you should modify it to make it as raw as possible before proceeding to uploading it to Tableau.

## The sample dataset

Located in `C:\Users\My_user\Documents\My Tableau Repository\Datasources\2020.3\en_US-US` or a similar path, the sample dataset `Sample - Superstore.xls` contains three sheets `Orders`, `People` and `Returns` of a fictuous company. We will use this dataset to get along with Tableau Desktop features.

First open the Excel file, click on the `Orders` sheet and then launch a new Tableau worksheet by clicking on `Sheet 1` Tab in the bottom.
