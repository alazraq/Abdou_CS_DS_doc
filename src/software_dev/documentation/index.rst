Documenting Software
####################

Documenting software is in my opinion one of the most important phases of software development. 
To me, a software that is not documented does not exist. Period.

All independent pieces of software should be documented. Typically, a single service (generally speaking, a single repository) inside a bigger project will have two documentations:

- **General documentation:** High-level overview of what that service does and how it is implemented. This should contain an overview of the service, instructions for CI/CD and deployments, and tutorials if some are needed. This should probably be contained in its own repo if the project is big enough and published to a website dedicated to the doc, or in the readme.rst (prefer .rst to .md) for smaller projects.

- **Code documentation:** Low-level code documentation for classes, packages, functions, variabes, etc. This documentation should be placed inside a specific folder (for example /docs folder) in the serviceâ€™s repository. It should be generated automatically using pipelines and be made available online as well with proper authentication using GCP app engine for example.
