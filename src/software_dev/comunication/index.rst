Inter-Process Communication
###########################

In computer science, inter-process communication or interprocess communication (IPC) refers to the mechanisms an operating system provides to allow the processes to communicate with each other and manage shared data.

Typically, applications can use IPC, categorized as clients and servers, where the client requests data and the server responds to client requests.
Many applications are both clients and servers, as commonly seen in distributed computing.
