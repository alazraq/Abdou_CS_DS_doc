# Cloud Batch Info
## Tools:

4. Vue.js: Vue  is a front-end framework: a progressive framework for building user interfaces (frontend development). The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries. Other frameworks include ionic-angular, ruby on rails, asp.net, ...
5. Quasar Framework for Vue.js: Quasar is an open-source Vue.js based framework, which allows you as a web developer to quickly create responsive++ websites/apps in many flavours: SPAs (Single Page App) - SSR (Server-side Rendered App) (+ optional PWA client takeover) - PWAs (Progressive Web App) - Mobile Apps (Android, iOS, …) through Apache Cordova - Multi-platform Desktop Apps (using Electron). Quasar’s goal is: write code once and simultaneously deploy it as a website, a Mobile App and/or an Electron App. 
6. Yarn: Yarn is a new package manager that replaces the existing workflow for the npm client or other package managers while remaining compatible with the npm registry. It has the same feature set as existing workflows while operating faster, more securely, and more reliably.
7. Cordova: Apache Cordova is an open-source mobile development framework. It allows you to use standard web technologies - HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for cross-platform development. Applications execute within wrappers targeted to each platform, and rely on standards-compliant API bindings to access each device's capabilities such as sensors, data, network status, etc. It is used for developing hybrid apps.
8. Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts.
9. ECMAScript (or ES) is a scripting-language specification standardized by Ecma International. It was created to standardize JavaScript, so as to foster multiple independent implementations. JavaScript has remained the best-known implementation of ECMAScript since the standard was first published, with other well-known implementations including JScript and ActionScript.[2] ECMAScript is commonly used for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web, and it is increasingly being used for writing server applications and services using Node.js.
10. Flask (python): Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.

## Concepts:

2. Moment (Java): A moment (as used in the Java parlance) is a unique point on the time-line; it represent the same instant, wherever you stand on Earth (by opposition to a date + hour which can represent very different moments depending on the time zone you are in).
3. API: In computer programming, an application programming interface (API) is a set of subroutine definitions, communication protocols, and tools for building software. In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication among various components. A good API makes it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer. Documentation for the API usually is provided to facilitate usage and implementation.
4. Representational State Transfer (REST): REST is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services. Web services that conform to the REST architectural style, called RESTful Web services (RWS), provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. Six guiding constraints define a RESTful system: Client-server architecture, Statelessness, Cacheability, Layered system, Uniform interface. REST API are the APIs that conform to these six rules.
5. progressive web apps (pwa): Progressive Web Apps provide an installable, app-like experience on desktop and mobile that are built and delivered directly via the web. They're web apps that are fast and reliable. And most importantly, they're web apps that work in any browser. Progressive Web Apps can run in a browser tab, but are also installable. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/ for a detailed walkthrough of your first pwa.
6. hybrid app: hybrid app -- a web app wrapped in a native container that can be installed from the app store.
7. native app: A native application is a software program that is developed for use on a particular platform or device. ... Native apps can provide optimized performance and take advantage of the latest technology, such as a GPS, compared to web apps or mobile cloud apps developed to be generic across multiple systems. It is coded in a specific programming language, such as Objective C for iOS or Java for Android operating systems. Native mobile apps provide fast performance and a high degree of reliability.
8. terminal vs terminal emulator etc... more research to be done on: What is the exact difference between a 'terminal', a 'shell', a 'tty' and a 'console'?
9. CLI: Command Line interface
10. TCP: Abbreviation of Transmission Control Protocol, and pronounced as separate letters. TCP is one of the main protocols in TCP/IP networks. Whereas the IP protocol deals only with packets, TCP enables two hosts to establish a connection and exchange streams of data. TCP guarantees delivery of data and also guarantees that packets will be delivered in the same order in which they were sent.
11. Linter: Lint, or a linter, is a tool that analyzes source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.

13. Web framework (ex: flask): A web framework (WF) or web application framework (WAF) is a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources, and web APIs.

14. Front-end and backend: A static website or web app (one that does not support user interaction) can be entirely written using front-end development tools: HTML- Javascript and css. Backend or server side stores the data and the algorithms that allow the front-end to run smoothly, common backend languages include PHP, Java, Python and JavaScript was introduced in recent years as a Backend programming language provided Node.js which is a runtime environment that allows it to run outside of the browser.

15. SDK vs API: "All SDKs are/contain APIs but not all APIs are SDKs"
- SDK: (Software Development Kit) An SDK is a complete set of APIs that allow you to perform any action you would need for creating applications. In addition an SDK may include other tools for developing for the platform/item that it is for.

- An API on the other hand is just a series of related methods that may be good for a specific purpose.

- As an example, the JDK (Java Development Kit) contains the API as well as the compilers, runtimes, and other miscellaneous tools. The Java API is simply all the libraries that make up the core language that you can work with out of the box.
