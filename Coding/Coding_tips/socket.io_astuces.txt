1- What is socket.io: Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server. It consists of:
- a Node.js server
- a Javascript client library for the browser (which can be also run from Node.js)

2- flask-socket.io: is a flask extension that wraps the original socket.io and allows you to use it with flask.
a- Basic example: Chat app

from flask import Flask 
from flask_socketio import SocketIO, send

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'mysecret' # all messages are encrypted so we have an encryption key and we save that as a config value
socketio = SocketIO(app)

@socketio.on('message')
def handleMessage(msg):
	print('Message: ' + msg)
	send(msg, broadcast=True)

if __name__ == '__main__':
	socketio.run(app) # instead of app.run, takes the usual flask up and wraps socket.io around it.
