node.js astuces:

1- What is Node.js
- Definition: Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[7] unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts. Before, you could only run your javascript inside a browser, with each browser having a JS engine like v8 for chrome, spidermonkey for firefox etc. A browser has a JS engine and a runtime environment that can execute the javascript code. Node.js is a runtime environment to execute this JS code outside of a browser, in combination with the v8 JS engine of google you obtain node.exe that can execute javascript entirely outside of a browser. So chrome and Node.exe have the same v8 JS engine but different runtime environments. 
- Node gives you more possibilities than the browser, for example access the file system, the network, etc...
- Node is not a programming language, and not a framework for web development, it is a runtime environment for JS.

2- How does Node.js work?
- Node.js request are executed asynchronously by default using an evant queue --> ideal for i/o intensive and real-time apps, not ideal for CPU intensive apps,
