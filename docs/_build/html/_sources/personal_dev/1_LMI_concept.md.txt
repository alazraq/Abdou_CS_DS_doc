# LMI Sales: Lesson 1: The LMI Concept

The LMI Concept covers Success, Motivation, Attitudes, Conditioning, and the Slight Edge.

## ♕ Success

> **Success is defined as: the Progressive Realization of Worthwhile, Predetermined Personal Goals.**

- Success is ⌚ **PROGRESSIVE**. It is ongoing and dynamic. It is a journey – not a destination. Progressive means that you are successful as soon as you set a goal and begin working on it. Success comes, not when you reach a goal, but as soon as you take action to accomplish it.

- Success means ✓ **REALIZATION**. This means that you are actually ac- complishing goals. You don’t just set goals, you are realizing them.

- Success means your goals are 🌹 **WORTHWHILE** (rentable, qui vqut la peine). You might ask, “Worthwhile to whom?” Well, first of all, worthwhile to you. Your goals might also be worthwhile to others and they must be worthwhile in that they do not violate God’s or mankind’s laws.

- Our goals must be ⏱ **PREDETERMINED**. Basically, this says we must think about our goals and plan for them. You need to know where you will be one year, three years, and five years from now. Predetermined suggests that you decide in advance what your goals will be.

- Your goals are ✍ **PERSONAL**. They must be your goals. Someone else does not choose them for you. When you work to achieve someone else’s goals, you are not as motivated as when you work to reach your own.

- And finally, the word GOALS. Your Goals must be **Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Tangible – and encompass every area of your life**: Family and Home; Financial and Career; Mental and Educational; Physical and Health; Social and Cultural; and Spiritual and Ethical.

## ☆ Motivation

### Definition

MOTIVATION is made of two words: motive and action. 
- Action is another word for movement or motion. 
- A motive is a reason, a purpose or a goal. 

> **So, motivation is movement toward a goal. Motivation means Goal-Directed Action.**

### Types

The three types of motivation are:

- **⚔ Fear** – based on the use of force or punishment.

    It motivates you to act because you fear something that will happen if you do not act. Fear Motivation is **external**; somebody has to provide the fear. Remember the saying... But what happens when that someone -like your boss- is absent? 
    
    People build up an immunity to Fear Motivation. They learn to work just hard enough to keep management off their backs.

- **🍕 Incentive** – based on rewards and incentives

    Incentives can be bonuses, trips, prizes and other rewards for a job well done. Do they work? Sure they do – up to a point. But what happens is that last year’s incentive is this year’s expectation. Incentive Motivation has the same weakness as Fear Motivation in that it is **external**.

- **☯ Attitude** – based on changing the way people think

    Attitude Motivation works because it is internal, not external. This means you motivate yourself; you don’t rely on anyone else to motivate you.

### Example to illustrate the differente types of motivation: The donkey pulling a cart

- motivated by a carrot on a stick: First, the 🐎 donkey must be hungry and like carrots; the load in the cart must be light enough; the carrot must be big, juicy and attractive enough; and the stick must be the right length, not too long and not too short. If all of those elements are just right, Incentive Motivation works, and the donkey pulls the cart.

- motivated by the fear of a whip: When you take away the carrot and just use the stick as a whip, you have Fear Motivation. That may work for a while.

- change the donkey into a 🏇 good horse that ran for the pure joy of running? There would be no need for a carrot or a whip.

Well, we’re not dealing with donkeys; we’re dealing with people... and people are good horses to start with...and if they are treated like good horses they will perform like good horses. That’s where Attitude Motivation comes into play.

## Attitude change: the power of habits

### The Power of habits

Now I’m going to show you how Attitude Motivation will literally change your life and give you more control than you ever realized.

Almost everything we do every day is done from **habit**. We learn to do things and they become habits. We form habits from our young age, then these things are automatic and reflexive.
It has been said that first you make your habits and then your habits make or break you. 

Since habits are so important, let’s look at how they are formed and how they can be changed. 

### Sparsed repetitions to success

- SPACED REPETITION
- CONDITIONING 
- ATTITUDE – Habit of Thought
- BEHAVIOR – ACT 
- RESULTS 
- SUCCESS

1. **Results -> Success**

The degree of SUCCESS that you enjoy in life depends on the RESULTS that you produce. The greater the RESULTS, the greater your SUCCESS.

2. **Behavior -> Results**

The RESULTS you produce are the consequence of your BEHAVIOR, or the way you act.

3. **Attitude -> Behavior**

Your BEHAVIOR reflects your ATTITUDE, the way you habitually think. In fact, “Habit of Thought” is a perfect description of what an ATTITUDE is:

1. **Conditionning -> Attitude**

Your ATTITUDES, or your Habits of Thought, are the result of your CONDITIONING. Conditioning is just another word for “habit.” We have all been conditioned to think and act in certain ways by family, friends, teachers, spiritual leaders and others who have influenced us throughout our lives.

1. **Spaced repetitions -> conditionning**

And finally, our CONDITIONING was caused by the REPETITION of certain ideas and actions over extended periods of time. We call it SPACED REPETITION because it occurs over and over with intervals of time in between.

### Conclusion: you can get to success by manipulating your spaced repetitions

Now here’s the exciting part. If this is the process that has brought us to where we are today, it means that we can use this same process to determine how we will live in the future. In other words...

When you have SPACED REPETITION of powerful ideas and actions, you can change your CONDITIONING process so that your Habits of Thought, your ATTITUDES, change too. The change in ATTITUDE will bring about changes in BEHAVIOR and the RESULTS you achieve will improve and grow in significance. With improved RESULTS the quality and quantity of the SUCCESS you enjoy will also increase.
