# Kubeflow Tutorial

## What is Kubeflow?

Kubeflow is a platform for deploying a machine learning (ML) system for development, testing, and production-level serving.

Kubeflow is the ML toolkit for Kubernetes. It is a platform for arranging the components of your ML system on top of Kubernetes.

Using the Kubeflow configuration user interfaces you can specify the ML tools required for your workflow (Pytorch, Tensorflow, etc). Then you can deploy the workflow to various clouds, local, and on-premises platforms for experimentation and for production use.

Here we are mostly interested in Kubeflow Pipelines.
