Abderrahmane Lazraq's documentation
###################################

Welcome to my personal documentation!

This website documents tutorials, tips and tricks I accumulated during my studies at four different schools across three countries - Ecole Polytechnique, HEC Paris, Carnegie Mellon University and EPFL - as well as during my end of studies internship at Microsoft and working as software engineer, lead data scientist then head of engineering for more than 4 years at Virtual Traffic Lights LLC. 

The goal is to provide a centralized documentation for future reference if faced with similar tasks to accomplish and to share knowledge. 

Please note that this is work in progress as I continue writing articles while learning, but I don't necessarily have time to document everything I learned so I will tend to focus on the subjects that are more relevant to my current work and interests.
