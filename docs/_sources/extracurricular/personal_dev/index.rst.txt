Personal Development
####################

I am a firm believer in the process of personal development as a way to **progressively realize worthwhile, predetermined personal goals** (which is how I define success), but also to set up a goal planning and an atomic habits system to frame this process.

The goal of this section is to share with you the concepts and ideas that had the biggest influence on my personal development, most of which come from books I read, seminars and classes I attended, and discussions I sparked with personal development coaches since the age of 10.
