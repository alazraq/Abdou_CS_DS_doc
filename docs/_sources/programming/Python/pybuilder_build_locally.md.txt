# Building a package locally using pybuilder


- You can use the following pip install command to install pybuilder ``pip install pybuilder``.
- Then you can use the following commands to publish a version of your package locally (you can execute it within ``trafluid_gym_environment`` for example after you have made changes)

```
export VERSION="0.3.133"
pyb publish
```

- Then you can go to where you want to install the package (``trafluid_rl_agents`` for example) and install the package directly from the ta.gz generated by pyb ( for example in my case ``pip install home\user\trafluid_gym_environment/target/dist/trafluid_gym_environment-0.3.133``):

```
pip install <path to .tar.gz generated by pyb>
```

That's it, you can now import the new version of your package in other places on your local environment, this can be very handy for quick development and testing.
