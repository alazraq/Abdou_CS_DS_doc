Here we will focus on Tableau Desktop and Tableau Prep Builder. 
Details about the Tableau application suite as well as instructions for installing Tableau Desktop
can be found in Chapter 1 of the book.

Best practices of data visualization
------------------------------------

- Anscombe's quartet shows how important visualizing data is instead of just using descriptive statistics.
- Color, length, width, orientation, siza, shape, surrounding are some elements to highlight one element and set it apart from others.
- Choice of type of graph is very important. For example bar plot to compare counts of something instead of pie chart.
- Human eye can distingush around 8 colors, do not use more than that in a viz. 
- Data viz is not neutral, same info represented differently can express different things, eg. Iraq's death toll.
