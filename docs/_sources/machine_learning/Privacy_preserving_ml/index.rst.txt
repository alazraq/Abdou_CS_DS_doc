Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning
###################################

**Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (or PPML for short)** refers to the  privacy-enhancing techniques concentrated on allowing multiple input parties to collaboratively train ML models without releasing their private data in its original form.

In this blog, we focus on the foundations of cryptographic protection of data processing, and steadily build-up to advanced PPML techniques. I wrote this blog as part of my personal project at HEC Paris in March 2021.
