Finance  
#######

This article is based on the introductory course on finance I attended at HEC Paris, given by Prof. Jean-Edouard Colliard and Prof. Johan Hombert. 
It covers the basic principles of finance, describes the role and functioning of the main types of financial institutions, and introduces some fundamental models. 
It also focuses on students with Data Science Backgrounds like myself.
