# Asset Valuation

The goal of this session is to answer the following question:

> What determines the value of assets, i.e., the price at which assets trade in markets?
> What they are used for: financing, sharing risk, etc.
> How they are created and traded: IPOs, exchanges, etc.

Ex.: Lemonade sold 20% of its shares for $319M. How investors came up with this valuation?

## Introduction to asset valuation

– **Assets:** include stocks, bonds, bank loans, insurance contracts, etc.
- **Valuation principle:** Value of asset = Value of benefits (cash flow, see next point) generated by the asset.
- **Cash Flow** or CF for brevity, refers to all the benefits generated by an asset. These benefits can be non-monetary (e.g. environmental) but are usually in cash:
    - bonds and loans -> interests
    - stocks -> dividends 
    - patents -> royalties etc
- **Challenges in asset valuation:**
    - ``Forcasting the Cash Flow`` using data, this is the job of data scientists.
    - ``Determining the value of the forcated Cash Flow``, this is the job of economists. This class about this second point.
- Finance is all about valuing future (discounting for time) uncertain (discounting for risk) cash flows.

## Risk-free assets

In risk-free cashflows, we only account for time discounting.

### Time discounting

- **Time preference:** Future cash flows are discounted as people always prefer money today as opposed to many tomorrow.
- **Present Value (PV):** If you are indifferent between having X € now and 1 € is one year, then X is the present value of 1 € in one year. The Present value (PV) of an asset is how much it is worth today.
- **Discount rate (r):** r such that PV = 1/(1+r) is called the discount rate. It is often expressed on a per year basis (e.g. every year 5% is discounted)
- Example: If you are indifferent between having 0.95 € now and 1 € in one year, then the PV of 1 € in one year is 0.95 € and the discount rate is r = 1/0.95 - 1 = 0.05 = 5 %
- **Maturity:** when the bond or loan is due to be paid.

### PV of risk-free cash flow: Valuing risk-free assets

- The **PV of a cash flow** $D_t$ € in t years is $PV = D_t / (1 + r)^t$ accounting for the fact that r is on a per-year basis. 
- The **PV of a stream of such cash flows** is the sum of this previous term for t going from 1 to infinity.
- Example: valuing_risk_free.png
- The **return rate** is (what you get)/(what you paid) and refers to how much you win in percentage. It is equal to the discount rate for a risk-free asset. 

### Risk-free interest rate

- For a risk-free asset, the **risk-free interest rate (r_f)** is defined as: 
    > Discount rate = return rate = risk-free interest rate
- r_f is the same for all risk-free assets with cash flow at the same date in the same currency.
- Risk-free interest rate depends on 
    - The maturity (Horizon of the cash flow)
    - The currency 
- Risk-free interest rate can be nefgative, explanation given in another class.

### Market efficiency

- Negative return rate -> You give the government 101 euros to buy a bond, and you get 100 euro in return in one year
- Many people want to save they money -> More people want to buy bonds

## Risky assets

### Risk aversion

- Risk averse: staying away fron risk, investores are willing to accept a lower payoff if the risk is lower.

### Valuing risky assets

- Commodities: gold, silver etc have high risk (Standard deviation) and not so high return in mean.


### Valuing the stock market

- The dot-com bubble (also known as the dot-com boom, the tech bubble, and the Internet bubble) was a stock market bubble caused by excessive speculation in Internet-related companies in the late 1990s, a period of massive growth in the use and adoption of the Internet. They tought g was high.

## Diversification

- Cov = 0.2 sigma^2 -> there is some positive correlation between the companies so they tend to move in the same direction (for example in the same industry) so investing in these companies together is riskier.

- Law of large numbers: when the correlation is 0 then when n the number of investments in diversified companies is high, the risk disapears.

- Risk is either idiosyncratic (can be eliminated by diversification) or systematic (cannot be diversified away)

- We require higher expected return on risquier portfolios (rho high), we only require risk free returns (risk premium of 0) for safe portfolios (rho = 0)

## The CAPM: Capital Asset Pricing Model

- Market portfolio: all assets traded on the market
- Market beta: exposure to market risk, covariance between our return and the return of all the assets in the economy -> captures only systematic risk. Higher beta means the industry varies beta when the market grows by 1%. Negative beta can also exist but are rare.
- Assumptions: People can diversify, no market segmentation -> iprovement of the CAPM in this case.
- CAPM: The risk premium of asset I = market beta of the asset * market risk premium
- Industry is procyclical: goes up 1.2%
