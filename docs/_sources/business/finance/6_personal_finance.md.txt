# Personal finance

## Key takeaways

- **Personal finance** is a term that covers managing your money as well as saving and investing to meet your financial goals. It encompasses budgeting, banking, insurance, mortgages, investments, retirement planning, and tax and estate planning.
- Few schools have courses in how to manage your money, so it is important to **learn the basics through free online articles**, courses, blogs, podcasts, or at the library. For example [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personalfinance.asp) is used to write this article.
- Smart personal finance involves **developing strategies** that include budgeting, creating an emergency fund, paying off debt, using credit cards wisely, saving for retirement, and more.
- Being disciplined is important, but it’s also good to **know when to break the rules** — for example, young adults who are told to invest 10% to 20% of their income for retirement may need to take some of those funds to buy a home or pay off debt instead.
