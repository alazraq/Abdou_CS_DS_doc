# Testing Software

## Types of tests

There are many types of tests for software components among which:

### Unit tests
- Testing indicidual function

### Integration tests
- Verify that different modules or services used by the application work well together

## Testing in python

There are many libraries for testing in python, we recommend going with **pytest**
- Rich community
- Can execute tests of other libraries
- Detailed info about failed asserts

Mimesis is a library in python for generating fake data for tests: jsons, xml files and other data types.

## Source code coverage
- The classic metric used to identify how much of the source code is being reached by the unit tests.
- Att: 100% code coverage doesn't mean you have tested everything.
- For Python use coverage.py
