Building and Packaging Software
###############################

In software development, a build is the process of converting source code files into standalone software artifact(s) that can be run on a computer, or the result of doing so. 

For example for a Java app this artifact can be a runnable JAR, for an Android app it could be an APK.

Building software is the second to last step in the software development process before deployment. 

The focus of this article will be on build automation, which is the process of automating the creation of a software build and the associated processes including: compiling computer source code into binary code, packaging binary code, and running automated tests.
