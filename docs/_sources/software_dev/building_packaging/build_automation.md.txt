# Build Automation

Build automation involves scripting or automating the process of compiling computer source code into binary code. 

A list of the most important tools can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_build_automation_software).

Historically, build automation was accomplished through makefiles. Today, there are two general categories of tools.

- **Build-automation utility:** This includes utilities like Make, Rake, CMake, MSBuild, Ant, Maven or Gradle (Java) etc. Their primary purpose is to generate build artifacts through activities like compiling and linking source code.
- **Build-automation servers:** These are general web based tools that execute build-automation utilities on a scheduled or triggered basis; a continuous integration server is a type of build-automation server.
