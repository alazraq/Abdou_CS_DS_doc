Abderrahmane Lazraq's documentation
###################################

Welcome to Abdou's documentation!

This documentation contains tutorials, tips and tricks learned by Abdou during his studies in four different institutions - EPFL, Carnegie Mellon University, Ecole Polytechnique and HEC Paris - and working part-time as a software developer and data science intern for more than 2 years for Virtual Traffic Lights LLC. 

The goal is to provide a centralized documentation for future reference if faced with similar tasks to accomplish and to share knowledge.
